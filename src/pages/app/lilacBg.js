              <h1>Lilac LaBelle</h1>
            </div>
            <p>You, Lilac LaBelle are Libby LaBelle’s first cousin (their fathers were brothers) who grew up in rural Georgia. You went to grade school and high school together and (at least on the surface) were inseparable. You looked so much alike that people frequently mistook you for her.</p>
            <p>Libby was always the “realist” you were the “romantic.” Libby was headstrong, never minced words and told people exactly what she thought. This got her a lot of attention and she liked it. The older she got, the more acerbic and snarky she became. You, on the other hand, were filled with Southern charm. You had many admirers and enjoyed leading them along before dashing their hopes with a “sweet goodbye.”</p>
            <p>You and Libby moved to Atlanta together 25 years ago and shared a small flat. Libby became a stringer for local community newspapers and you went to beauty school. All was well until you fell madly in love with Brett Cutler, an attractive man you’d met at a garden party. Brett was everything you wanted in a man. He had very little money, working odd jobs to make ends meet, but he was tall, dark and handsome, and you saw “potential” in his abilities.</p>
            <p>Brett was an orphan who’d grown up in foster homes. He’d never had the chance to attend college, but had a lot of “street smarts.” He wanted to move to New York where he felt his innate abilities would lead to success. You said you’d never leave Atlanta. Brett was torn. He was deeply in love with you, but “the big time” beckoned.</p>
            <p>You introduced Libby to Brett – this was a mistake. Brett was amazed at how similar you and Libby looked. Libby surreptitiously started to lure Brett away from you. She adopted your Southern demeanor around Brett with the sole purpose of “winning.” She didn’t really want Brett, but couldn’t resist proving to you that she could win him over.</p>
            <p>When Libby discovered that Brett wanted to move to New York, she decided that it was time for her to also move on to bigger and better things. It was 21 years ago that Libby enticed Brett to move to New York with her. Libby fabricated a resume and freelanced for several publications before landing a job two years later with “The Graphic News.” She really didn’t know much about art, but her columns created a lot of controversy and the publication’s circulation increased dramatically.</p>
            <p>Her column has become a big hit in art circles and she now enjoyed the power that she had in making or breaking careers – not just for artists, but for anyone associated with art, including caterers and event planners.</p>
            <p>You still longed to have Brett by your side and weren’t sure what happened to him. He hurt you terribly, and you keep telling yourself that you’ll forget him, but that hasn’t happened.</p>
            <p>Out of curiosity, you read Libby’s columns and are aware of her power to destroy careers. Four years ago, a column that she wrote about the cuisine at an exhibit in Soho caused an Italian chef, Luigi Lambrusco, to go out of business.</p>
            <p>A year later, a bad review of event planner Sharon Sharalike’s coordination of an Upper East Side gallery opening caused Sharalike to lose a large number of clients. Both have since started new businesses and are doing well.</p>
            <p>Libby consistently panned the work of impressionist Pete Casso. He’d become a hit with other art critics, but Libby called him a “charlatan.” She took every opportunity she could to be at his exhibit openings and reinforce her disdain for his work. She seemed obsessed with destroying his career to the point of showing up in out of the way spots just to make nasty comments about his talent.</p>
            <p>In that light, she destroyed the budding career of another artist, Fiona Fakes. Now, Libby is on the trail of an art forger.</p>
            <p>You finished beauty school and opened your own beauty salon. This put you in contact with the “beautiful people” of Atlanta. You continued to charm a bevy of men who would do anything for you – including buy you expensive trinkets and deposit large sums of money in her bank account. All of them wanted to make you their bride, but in your mind, none could compare to Brett, the man of her dreams. You took everything that your admirers offered because you “always depended upon the kindness of others.”</p>
            <p>Last year, a rich admirer died and left his entire estate to you. Now with enough money to support yourself, you were determined to “make things right” with your life. You despised Libby for what she did and hadn’t spoken to her in 21 years, you believe that Libby is the only person who can lead you to Brett.</p>
            <p>You took a deep breath and decided to “reconcile” with Libby. Your real motive was to find your lost love whom you’d lost track of. When she read in Libby’s column that Libby would be at the Creative Connection Art Gallery, you decided to be there too.</p>

                My dear cousin, Libby. I was so looking forward to seeing you again. We’d been apart for over 20 years and I knew it was time to let bygones be bygones. That’s why I showed up here tonight—but by the time I arrived, she’d already been taken away by the ambulance.</p>
                <p>We grew up together in Georgia and were inseparable. Some people thought we looked alike. It was only when she left for New York with my dear, dear Brett Cutler that we parted company. I read Libby’s columns regularly just to see what she was up to, but I had no idea what had happened to Brett.</p>
                <p>It was so glorious to see him here tonight. When he took off his disguise and showed everyone who he really is, my heart skipped a beat and I wanted to embrace him in a way that he’d never been embraced before. I’m certain we’ll have enough time for that later—after all of this mess has been taken care of.</p>
                <p>Now that he is obviously a man of independent means, we’ll be able to plan a life together that will be written about in romance novels.</p>
                <p>Good bye, my cousin. We’ll never be able to reconcile our differences. Wherever you are right now, I just want you to know that I will be in Brett’s arms forever. How does that make you feel, Libby?</p>

                <p>When the questioning begins, you should say that, on the way into the art gallery, you saw someone being loaded into an ambulance. You briefly looked inside before the paramedics told you to leave. If asked if you recognized the person in the ambulance, you should say the person looked “strangely familiar.”</p>
                <p>You enjoy wearing hats and it’s normal for you to have a large hatpin securing the hats against unexpected winds.</p>

                <p>A cousin of mine who went to school with Libby LaBelle told me that she has a cousin named Lilac. The two of them were inseparable when they were growing up, but something happened that caused them to stop speaking to each other.</p>

                <p>I’ve been told that Libby LaBelle once had a relationship with a man who’d followed her from Georgia to live in New York. People say that Libby treated him with such disdain that he eventually left her.</p>

                <p>My niece never misses reading Libby LaBelle’s column in “The Graphic News.” She knows what Libby looks like and once thought she’d spotted her at an event in Atlanta. She excitedly approached and said, “Libby, I’m a big fan.” The woman replied, “You’re mistaken, honey. My name is Lilac. Don’t ever call me Libby again.”</p>
