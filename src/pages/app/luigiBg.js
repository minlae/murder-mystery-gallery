              <h1>Luigi Lambrusco</h1>
            </div>
            <p>You, Luigi Lambrusco, are an Italian chef. You were born in Tuscany and studied at the Cordon Rouge School where you learned your culinary skills and excelled among your classmates. In addition to knowing the ins and out of Italian cuisine, you are also a wine connoisseur, paying particular attention to those produced in your homeland.</p>
            <p>Six years ago, after operating a successful catering business in Italy, you decided to try your skills in New York City. You packed up, bid “arrivederci” to friends and family and boarded a plane to The Big Apple. Your mastery of European flair and style soon put you on a path to fame and profit. Your business, which you called “Bellissimo Cibo” (it means “beautiful food”) soon flourished and you opened a restaurant by the same name in the heart of Manhattan.</p>
            <p>All was going well until four years ago when you catered the opening of a new art exhibit at a gallery in Soho. “The Graphic News” sent its art critic, Libby LaBelle, to cover it. She was snarky and nasty. After panning the artist, she sampled some of your cuisine and started to gag. She accused you of trying to poison her and dramatically spit your food on the floor. She then took a sip of the wine you were serving and said it tasted like turpentine.</p>
            <p>In her column the next day, she not only made scathing comments about the artist, but also about your cuisine and wine. The review was so bad that your business and restaurant failed. You had to accepted jobs as a short order cook, barely getting by.</p>
            <p>You were working at a small diner near Times Square when a regular customer made a point of saying how good your cooking was. That’s how, two years ago, you met Sharon Sharalike. The two of you had a drink together and were surprised to find that you both have a vendetta against Libby LaBelle.</p>
            <p>Sharon is an event planner. The previous year (three years ago) she’d been hired by an art gallery on the Upper West Side to organize an exhibit. LaBelle wrote in her review that the event was like “ . . . like watching an elephant snooze without all of the usual excitement.”</p>
            <p>Sharon’s high-priced clients dried up and she was forced to lower her fees and begin planning lesser-known events.</p>
            <p>After a rough period, she told you she’d begun to build a new business, “Sharon the Excitement.” She told you that you would be her “caterer of choice” for any future events. She has kept that promise. Because of her bookings, you’ve been able to rebuild your reputation and have started a new company called “Cibo da Morire.” (It means “Food to Die for.”)</p>
            <p>You and Sharon have become close friends and confidantes. You call her “Sharini.” By working together, the two of you have been able to make a comeback. That’s how you were booked to cater the event at the Creative Connection Art Gallery.</p>
            <p>Nine months ago, Sharon contacted you and said she’d been retained by the gallery to plan the “preview” of an exhibit by impressionistic artist Pete Casso. She recommended that you do the catering. Both of you suspected that Libby LaBelle would be there because she couldn’t pass up another opportunity to write an acerbic review of Casso’s work.</p>
            <p>You don’t like Libby LaBelle, but you are a realist. You’re willing to try to get back into her good graces because you know what a bad review from Libby could mean.</p>
            <p>Sharon, on the other hand, still holds a huge grudge. She strongly dislikes Libby and has even suggested that you put something in the wine you serve to her. Instead, you’ve selected food and wine that you hope will change Libby’s mind about you.</p>
            <p>The two of you are quite a contrast. You are usually dressed in chef gear while Sharon likes fashionable clothes. She’s even begun wearing spiked heels which sometimes damage the clients’ floors. Sharon jokingly (at least you think it was a joke) said to you that, “It would be a real kick to be around Libby LaBelle again.”</p>

                <p><span className="italic">(Speak with an Itallian accent.)</span><br/>
                Grazi to all of you. I appreciate the kind words you say about my food and wine. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but you must agree that Libby LaBelle had it all wrong when she said such mean things about my cuisine.</p>
                <p>Why I even picked a special wine and made some appetizers to die for, just for her. Still, she didn’t seem to like them. Some people are hard to please. But, Sharini knows a quality chef when she sees one. I want to thank her for choosing me to be with her here at the gallery.</p>
                <p>When Libby LaBelle staggered toward me earlier tonight, I didn’t know what to make of it. It was the first time I’d been that close to her and I was afraid that she might hurt herself. I was carrying a sharp fork that I’d been using to serve the meat. Luckily, I reacted in time to prevent a serious injury.</p>
                <p>I am a romantic at heart—just like all Italians. So, it brought tears to my eyes to see Lilac LaBelle and Brett Cutler reunite here in the gallery.</p>
                <p>I can tell they are truly in love and would do away with anything that might come between them. Lilac is so beautiful and Brett is so handsome. They are a perfect couple.</p>
                <p>It’s too bad that Lilac’s cousin, Libby, wasn’t here to see them.</p>

                <p>As you are circulating among the members of the audience, carry a large fork and gesture as you are speaking. (Be very Italian.)</p>
                <p>When you talk to guests who are drinking wine, say that nothing compares to Italian wine. Reinforce the fact that you know a lot about wine and always personally try to match the vintage to the person who’s drinking it.</p>

                <p>I’m very impressed at the quality of Luigi Lambrusco’s kitchen. Everything she has is state of the art. Her knives look like they could cut through metal. I hope no one accidentally gets cut by one of them. The injury could be serious.</p>

              <div className="clue-container">
                <div className="clue-image"></div>
                <p>I’m a fan of Libby LaBelle and religiously read her column in “The Graphic News.” That’s why I’m surprised that Luigi Lambrusco was hired to cater this event. A few years ago, Libby panned the cuisine that Lambrusco provided for an exhibit opening in New York. I’ve heard that, because of that review, Lambrusco lost a lot of business.</p>

              <div className="clue-container">
                <div className="clue-image"></div>
                <p>I’ve noticed that Luigi Lambrusco considers himself to be a real connoisseur of wine. In fact, the wine menu at her restaurant is quite extensive. Naturally, he focuses on Italian vintages.</p>
