              <h1>Brett Cutler</h1>
            </div>
            <p>You, Brett Cutler, were an orphan who grew up in foster homes in rural Georgia. You never had the chance to attend college, but had a lot of “street smarts.” You wanted to move to New York where you felt his your abilities would lead to success.</p>
            <p>You instead moved to Atlanta, but had very little money, working odd jobs to make ends meet. Your good looks made you attractive to women. That’s when, 23 years ago, you met Lilac LaBelle. She fell madly in love with you, and you with her. Then, she introduced you to her cousin, Libby.</p>
            <p>Libby and Lilac had moved to Atlanta together and shared a small flat. Libby was a stringer for local community newspapers and Lilac went to beauty school. Lilac said she’d never leave Atlanta. You were torn. You were deeply in love with Lilac, but “the big time” beckoned.</p>
            <p>Libby and Lilac LaBelle were first cousins (their fathers were brothers) who grew up in rural Georgia. They went to grade school and high school together and (at least on the surface) were inseparable. They looked so much alike that people frequently mistook one for the other.</p>
            <p>Libby surreptitiously started to lure you away from Lilac. She adopted Lilac’s Southern demeanor around you with the sole purpose of “winning.”</p>
            <p>When Libby discovered that you wanted to move to New York, she decided that it was time for her to also move on to bigger and better things. It was 21 years ago that Libby enticed you to move to New York with her. Libby fabricated a resume and freelanced for several publications before landing a job with “The Graphic News” 19 years ago.</p>
            <p>She really didn’t know much about art, but her columns created a lot of controversy and the publication’s circulation increased dramatically.</p>
            <p>Her column has become a big hit in art circles and she enjoyed the power that she had in making or breaking careers – not just for artists, but for anyone associated with art, including caterers and event planners. Libby made a point of losing her Southern accent. She now sounded and acted like a “Nahyawkah."</p>
            <p>Your move to New York didn’t work out the way you’d hoped. You found an occasional part-time job, but success didn’t immediately land on your shoulders. However, because of Libby’s connections, you were able to meet a lot of artists and gallery owners. You began to identify and appreciate good art. Libby, in fact, had become very good at critiquing art, and you realized that you could make a lot of money dealing in it.</p>
            <p>Ten years ago, Libby tired of you. She threw you out because she didn’t need you anymore, and you didn’t live up to the “image” she needed to project.</p>
            <p>You were penniless, but ambitious. You realized you’d made a mistake by forsaking Lilac for Libby, but you couldn’t return to your lost love as a failure. You resolved to become a billionaire, rub Libby’s nose in her decision to cast you aside, and reunite with Lilac.</p>
            <p>Libby continued her destruction of careers. Four years ago, a column that she wrote about the cuisine at an exhibit in Soho caused an Italian chef, Luigi Lambrusco, to go out of business. A year later, a bad review of event planner Sharon Sharalike’s coordination of an Upper East Side gallery opening caused Sharalike to lose a large number of clients. Both have since started new businesses and are doing well.</p>
            <p>Libby has consistently panned the work of impressionist Pete Casso. He’s become a hit with other art critics, but Libby calls him a “charlatan.” She takes every opportunity she can to be at his exhibit openings and reinforce her disdain for his work. She is obsessed with destroying his career to the point of showing up in out of the way spots just to make nasty comments about his talent.</p>
            <p>You, on the other hand, are willing to purchase his works because of the outstanding opportunities they present for “investment.”</p>
            <p>You have, in fact, become a billionaire, dealing behind the scenes in art. When Libby threw you out, you managed to earn enough money at odd jobs to buy several underpriced paintings. You kept buying and selling art until you’d built a fortune. You made sure that all of your transactions were done clandestinely because you feared that Libby would try to sabotage your efforts.</p>
            <p>Now, you were ready to confront Libby and return to your true love, Lilac. You couldn’t wait to show off your success to Libby. You’ll meet her in disguise and, at the right time, discard it and show her you’re now rich. Then, you’ll track down Lilac and continue your relationship.</p>
            <p>You decided that the Creative Connection Art Gallery would be the perfect spot in which to do this.</p>

                Yes, I was in disguise earlier tonight. I hadn’t seen Libby in years and I wanted to reveal my true identity at just the right moment. I had no idea Lilac would also be here, too. It is wonderful to see her again after all these years.</p>
                <p>When we parted, I was penniless and on my way to New York with Libby to seek my fortune. As you can see, I am now a billionaire art dealer.</p>
                <p>I was in the crowd when Libby made those nasty remarks about Luigi Lambrusco and Pete Casso. She staggered to the front of the room as she was talking. I’ve seen her like that before, but she was having a more difficult time than she usually trying to get her words out. Libby was never one to be speechless.</p>
                <p>When Libby decided that something wasn’t worth her time, she’d make some hurtful remarks and discard it. I know all about that part of her personality.</p>
                <p>But, now that Lilac and I are together again, we can begin to plan a life that doesn’t include Libby. I’m sure we’re both speculating about what that will mean. Libby has been in both of our thoughts for so long that life without her just won’t be the same.</p>
                <p>I, of course, will be pleased to help you in solving this case—so long as Lilac is nearby.</p>

                <p>My sister said she recently met a man named Brett Cutler at a party. According to her, Cutler told the story of how he was once penniless as a result of a failed love affair. He said that since then he’d pulled himself together, become wealthy, and was trying to reunite with his “true love.”</p>
