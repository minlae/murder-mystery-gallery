              <h1>Pete Casso</h1>
            </div>
            <p>You, Pete Casso, are an impressionist artist whose work has received high critical acclaim – except from Graphic News art critic Libby LaBelle. She has consistently called you a “charlatan” and “amateurish.” As a result, you dislike her immensely and would welcome it if she would disappear altogether.</p>
            <p>You burst onto the New York art scene a decade ago when a small gallery on New York’ s Lower East Side, the Ersatz, “discovered” your work. Luckily, the gallery didn’t realize that, as Libby wrote, you really ARE a charlatan.</p>
            <p>You claim to have been educated in at the Sarbonne in Paris. In reality, you are the son of Iowa farmers. Your real name is Peter Kasinski, but you’ve been able to keep this a secret.</p>
            <p>When you were a teenager, you got a job as a barn painter and were very good at it, turning it into a career. About 10 years ago, you read in the local paper that an exhibit of impressionist art was about to open in Des Moines. The accompanying photos and the value placed on the art made you chuckle. They looked like something you could do.</p>
            <p>That’s when “Pete Casso” was born. You went to the exhibit carrying two canvasses that’s you quickly painted the previous night. You’d used a paint stirrer and some paint that was so old it had started to coagulate. You sold them to some unsuspecting art patron for a premium price and have never looked back. Since you have never married, you have no ties, so you bought a bus ticket to New York City, rented a flat in Greenwich Village, fabricated a long, impressive resume about your artistic credentials, and persuaded the Ersatz to exhibit your “work.”</p>
            <p>Suddenly, art critics got on the bandwagon, praising your paintings and calling them exhilarating, exciting and ahead of their time. You began selling your paintings to the rich and famous, all of whom took the word of critics that you were one of the revolutionaries of art.</p>
            <p>You swapped the paint stirrer for a large, sharp palette knife because it produces a similar effect on the canvas. Because of your “degree” from the Sarbonne, you’ve even taught classes at local colleges and universities. Most of your students are wealthy amateurs who like to brag about knowing you, leading to more sales and higher profits.</p>
            <p>One of your students, was <strong>Fiona Fakes</strong>, an accomplished artist who seemed adept at all types of media. She always asked a lot of questions – most of which you couldn’t answer, but you were able to talk around the responses. She always gave you quizzical “I can’t believe you said that” kind of looks. You’re not sure what her “real” reason was for taking the class.</p>
            <p>Nine months ago, the Creative Connection Art Gallery contacted you via an art agent, asking about your availability to exhibit your work. Since you were offered a hefty sum of money, you agreed to it. You also agreed to preview your exhibit by bringing “Black Cat at Midnight” and explaining its story. Your explanation, of course, is all pure fiction. It’s a good story and will increase your fame.</p>
            <p>Last month, you found out that Sharon Sharalike, a high-priced New York event planner, had been hired by the to coordinate the event. She is the ultimate professional, and has had some run-ins with Libby, who panned her ability to put together classy openings. Libby blasted Sharalike in her columns and, you’ve heard that Sharalike lost some very important clients because of what was written.</p>
            <p>And, amazingly enough, Luigi Lambrusco, an Italian chef, was hired to provide the cuisine for the opening. Lambrusco is another individual whose talents were denigrated by Libby LaBelle. You know that Sharon and Luigi have worked together in the past. It’s interesting that they would be here together at the gallery.</p>
            <p>Libby LaBelle was not convinced that your credentials are real. She’d been snooping into your background and you think she’d uncovered something because last month she wrote that you probably learned your artistic technique in “Barn Painting 101.”</p>
            <p>Last week, she wrote in her column that she would be attending your “preview” in the gallery. How did she even find out about it? You suspected she might be taking the opportunity to do more snooping – something that could threaten your “career.”</p>

                <p><span className="italic">(Blow kisses to the audience.)</span><br/>
                Thank you all for your warm reception tonight. Those of you who were here earlier had a chance to view “Black Cat at Midnight” in person. It’s now safely locked away. It took me years to complete.</p>
                <p>I found the perfect pigment for it in the rain forests of Belize. I had to be careful because any of the plants there are poisonous. The natives made sure I chose the right ones for what I had in mind.</p>
                <p>Using a sharp palette knife, I’ve perfected a technique that is unmatched by any other artist. My art work is revolutionary—every art critic, except Libby, says that. But, I don’t let it affect me.</p>
                <p>I understand that several forgeries of my work are being sold to galleries. That’s despicable. But it takes the proper artistic temperament to truly create a masterpiece. Don’t believe the reports that I have a violent temper. It’s only the passion I feel for my art.</p>
                <p>Yes, it’s unfortunate that Libby is dead, but art critics come and go constantly. They all think they are experts, but it’s really you who are the true critics. Now, you can appreciate my in its purest form.</p>

                <p>Carry an artist’s palette knife with you and use it to gesture as you are talking with people.</p>  
                <p>Since you have never really been to Paris, if people speak to you in French, or want to talk about Europe, say that, as an artist, you are concerned with the present and the future. The past is simply a shadow of what once was. It is all very hazy now.</p>
                <p>If you’re asked about “barn painting,” say that some of most-talented artists you’ve ever met had humble beginnings. (Expand on the precision that is required to paint a barn, but don’t admit to doing it.)</p>
                <p>If someone calls you “Kasinski,” look at them as if you’re going to answer, then pretend that you thought you heard “Casso.”</p>
