              <h1>Fiona Fakes</h1>
            </div>
            <p>You, Fiona Fakes (it’s pronounced fay-KESS) are an art forger – and a very good one at that. You didn’t start out trying to copy the works of famous artists. To the contrary, you thought you would be famous in your own right. You might have been had it not been for Libby LaBelle.</p>
            <p>You were raised in Sausalito, California, an artists’ community. Your parents ran an upscale boutique that catered to those who loved to buy something with a high price tag. When you graduated from high school, you went to the Art School of the West where you were an exemplary student.</p>
            <p>All of your instructors told you that you were extremely talented – especially because of your ability to see a work of art and mimic it stroke for stroke and line for line.</p>
            <p>You were so certain that you would be a famous artist that, five years ago, you left California and moved to New York where you set up your studio. You managed to procure exhibits a several small galleries on the lower east side, but your work didn’t catch on. Finally, four years ago, an upscale gallery agreed to display your work.</p>
            <p>Art critic Libby LaBelle of “The Graphic News” was invited to review the show. She panned the exhibit, and your career came to a stop.</p>
            <p>You had to find a way to make a living, so you decided to take a course at a local university by a visiting artist, Pete Casso. His revolutionary impressionistic work had been receiving rave reviews from art critics, with the exception of Libby LaBelle.</p>
            <p>You were easily able to master his palette knife technique and were soon producing works of art that look just like his. In the process, you realized that he is a charlatan and knows very little about art. He always skirts answering you when you have real questions about his work.</p>
            <p>However, your ability to produce fake Cassos made you realize that your true profession was that of an art forger. You were soon producing fakes that even the experts thought were real.</p>
            <p>Your talents run the gamut from oils to acrylics to watercolors, and you can even replicate large brush portraiture and Casso’s palette knife techniques. You are now making a considerable amount of money selling your forgeries to galleries that know what they’re getting, but that don’t mind because the cash flow is so good.</p>
            <p>Casso’s works are selling for millions. You’re more anxious than ever to examine his latest works and finetune your forgeries. You take any chance you can to get close to one of his recent “masterpieces” and examine his techniques. “Black Cat at Midnight” is said to be worth a lot of money. You want to examine it. That’s why you’re at the Creative Connection Art Gallery.</p>
            <p>In your attempt to be surreptitious about examining the works of other artists, you’ve begun wearing oversized, flashy jewelry. It has a dual purpose. Not only is it stylish, but it also hides a small magnifying glass and sharp edges that enable you to scrape “samples” of paint from the real masterpieces.</p>
            <p>For the past year, LaBelle has been writing in her column that she is on the trail of an art forger who is flooding the market with fakes. She listed the pieces that she believes are forgeries and, sure enough, they were all yours. Recently, LaBelle wrote that she will be naming the forger within the next week. You think she might be on to you. What would you do if she publishes your name?</p>

                <h2>Say this when asked to speak:</h2>
                <p>Don’t believe everything you hear tonight. Pete Casso might make a lot of money, but he’s not a great artist—that’s about the only thing Libby LaBelle and I agreed on. I took a class from Pete and he knows nothing about fine art. Ask him a question. I’ll bet you get an evasive answer.</p>
                <p>I’m the real artist! You’ve probably already see my work without realizing that I was one who was responsible for a thing of beauty. Put anything in front of me and I can make it into a work of art.</p>
                <p>My career would have taken off had it not been for that review Libby LaBelle gave me in “The Graphic News.” I still don’t understand why Libby had so much influence. People believed everything she said. Ridiculous!</p>
                <p>When I’m at an art gallery like this, I like to closely examine the artwork. That’s how I learn about the artist and the technique. You could say that I’m a real student of famous artists.</p>
                <p>You’ve probably read that Libby LaBelle said she’d discovered the identity of an art forger who’s been selling fake masterpieces. Now that she’s dead, I guess we’ll never find out who that person is.</p>
                <p>I’m sure some of you have your suspicions. But, unless you can prove something, you should keep them to yourself.</p>

                <p>As you are circulating among the members of the audience, constantly finger the jewelry and magnifying glass hanging around your neck. If you are asked about it, say that it’s like your “security blanket.”</p>
                <p>Tell people that you are an artist. If you are asked to describe your work, say that you “dabble in a lot of different mediums.”</p>
                <p>If you are asked about Libby, say that you no longer pay attention to what she writes. You have moved on with your career.</p>

                <p>A friend of Fiona Fakes told me that she is an amazing artist. She’s able to quickly analyze an artist’s technique and copy it precisely. I’m surprised that she hasn’t received better reviews from art critics.</p>

                <p>My nephew took an art class with Fiona Fakes and said she is proficient at all types of art. He was amazed at her skill not only with traditional art forms, but also with large brush portraiture and palette knives.</p>
