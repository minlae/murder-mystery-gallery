      <p>You, Sharon Sharalike, are an event planner who’s been retained by the Creative Connection Art Gallery to coordinate the preview of impressionistic artist Pete Casso’s upcoming exhibit.</p>
      <p>You began your career in event planning 25 years ago. You were hired by a New York company that organized large conventions and special events for big money clients. You worked you way up in both responsibility and compensation until, five years ago, starting your own event planning firm, “Events R Us.” You took several large clients with you and all was going well until, three years ago, when you were retained by an art gallery on the Upper West Side to organize an exhibit.</p>
      <p>Libby LaBelle, the art critic of “The Graphic News,” was at the event. You thought she was only there to review the exhibit, but she also took the opportunity to comment on your work. In her column, she wrote that the event was like “...watching an elephant snooze without all of the usual excitement.”</p>
      <p>Your high-priced clients dried up and you were forced to lower your fees and begin planning lesser-known events.</p>
      <p>Libby has been writing her column in “The Graphic News” for 19 years. She’s never discussed her credentials as an art critic, but has gained quite a following in the art world – much of it because of her acerbic style of writing. She is aware of the power she holds over people’s lives and relishes that position.</p>
      <p>After a rough period, you began to building a new business, “Sharon the Excitement.” You are working hard to get back on top and things are looking up. Two years ago, you were eating at your favorite diner on Times Square when you asked to meet the cook because the food was so good.</p>
      <p>That’s how you became friends with Luigi Lambrusco. The two of you had a drink together and were surprised to find that you both have a vendetta against Libby LaBelle.</p>
      <p>Libby had panned Luigi’s catering company, “Bellissimo Cibo” (it means “beautiful food”) when it catered a gallery opening in Soho. Luigi was forced to take a job in a diner in order to make ends meet. You supported him as he started a new catering company, “Cibo da Morire.” (It means “Food to Die for.”) You told him that he would be your “caterer of choice” for any future events. You’ve kept that promise.</p>
      <p>You and Luigi have become close friends and confidantes. He calls you “Sharini.” By working together, the two of you have been able to make a comeback.</p>
      <p>Nine months ago, you were retained by the Creative Connection Art Gallery to plan the “preview” of an exhibit by impressionistic artist Pete Casso. You recommended that Luigi do the catering. Both of you suspected that Libby LaBelle would be there because she wouldn’t be able to pass up another opportunity to write a snarky review of Casso’s work.</p>
      <p>Luigi doesn’t like Libby LaBelle, but he is a realist. He’s willing to try to get back into her good graces because she knows what a bad review from Libby could mean. You, on the other hand, still hold a huge grudge. You strongly dislike Libby LaBelle and have even suggested that Luigi put something in the wine he serves to her. Luigi thought you were kidding, but you were deadly serious.</p>
      <p>The two of you are quite a contrast. He is usually dressed in chef gear while you like fashionable clothes. You’ve even begun wearing spiked heels which sometimes damage the clients’ floors. You jokingly (at least you made it sound like a joke) said to him that, “It would be a real kick to be around Libby LaBelle again.”</p>
